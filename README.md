**Project**

For my Midcamp_project I chose a particular topic which is related to the medical field - Therefore, I found i suitable dataset about the stroke, which I was able to do Machine Learning a predict the false and true posite/negative.

However, for my presentation I wanted to see the relation between variables - which helped determine the relationship between particular variables to how likely individuals are from having a stroke.

My hypothesis - A stable marriage make you more likely to survive a stroke.

**Challenges**

For this project I had to be familiar with some key words, such as: BMI, heart disease, Hypertension, Glucose levels.

This was important in order to understand the impact of individuals lifestyle and stroke. The dataset was sufficient for machine learning, but i would like if the data was more specific and individual for me to have more concrete justification and understanding about the individuals lifestyle.
